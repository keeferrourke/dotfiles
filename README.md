# dotfiles

This repository contains some of my common configuration files. I keep track of
them in this repository with the help of
[this tool](https://github.com/jbernard/dotfiles).

When I was 13, I was obsessed with ricing my desktop. I've since grown out of
that, but may add some old (or new!) configs are I find/create them.
